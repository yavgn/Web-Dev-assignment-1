	<h2>About</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about? </br>
			I made navigation simpler by adding a nav and making a menu. You can now go from any page to another page by simply clicking the nav menu at the top.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			Which parts did you have trouble with? </br>
			I had quite a bit of trouble with poststatusprocess.php. Getting the permissions and database to work all together took some time to complete. The check database was problem for me as well and opted for a simpler method using two lines of code. <br><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			What would you like to do better next time? <br>
			Design, I want to learn how to style with CSS alot better. I want to get better at it and use it more in the future. I would also like to be able to program in php at home.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website? </br>
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3schools</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>. These provided a lot of content to create a website, not every method provided works so you must take some time for trial and error.<br><br> 
		</li>
		<li>
			What you have learnt along the way? </br>
			A lot of time goes into making a website, both back end and front end.</br>
